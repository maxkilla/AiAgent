Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Python 3.8 or higher
Pip (Python package installer)
Virtualenv (optional but recommended)
An OpenAI API key
Installation and Setup
1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agent-gpt-system.git
cd agent-gpt-system
2. Create a Virtual Environment
Create and activate a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
3. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the backend/ directory and install the necessary Python packages:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Set Up Environment Variables
You'll need to set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable. Replace your-openai-api-key with your actual OpenAI API key.

On macOS/Linux:

bash
Copy code
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-openai-api-key'
On Windows:

bash
Copy code
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
5. Run the Application
Start the Flask application by running:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
The application will start, and you can access it by navigating to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your web browser.

Usage
Once the application is running, you can:

Open a web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
Enter a request into the input field and click "Submit".
The response from the agent will be displayed on the screen.
Project Details
Frontend: Handles user input and displays the output. It consists of an HTML form, basic CSS for styling, and JavaScript to interact with the back-end.
Backend: Built with Flask, this handles incoming requests, communicates with OpenAI's API, and processes the response.
Agents: Each agent is a function in agents.py that performs specific tasks based on the user input.
